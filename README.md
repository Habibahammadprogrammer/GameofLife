This application is a simple demonstration of celluar automation 

states={0=empty,1=fish,2=shark}
it uses the following rules:


1)fish lives 10 generations


2)if more than 5 sharks are neighbours to a fish, fish dies (underpopulation)


3)if 8 neighbours of a fish are fish, fish dies (overpopulation)


4)if the cell is empty and has more than 4 neighbours of the same type, then the cell becomes that type

libraries used:
numpy 

matplotlib

application is till not accurate
